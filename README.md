Formulating Project Title

I'm currently focused on crafting a compelling project title for the GitHub repository. It needs to be clear and concise. I'm exploring different options to make it instantly understandable and attractive to potential users.

Outlining the Core Features

I've been working on the core features section. I'm focusing on highlighting upload, download, and file management capabilities. I'm also considering mentioning user accounts and secure links, which would enhance the platform's utility. I think incorporating user roles and permissions is a great idea too.

Refining the Project Plan

I've been further refining my plan for the README file. The initial title, "EzyShare - File Sharing Platform," seems strong and fitting. Now, I am considering the structure for "Features" to highlight uploading, downloading, and secure file sharing, which are the main focus of this platform. I'm also planning the technologies section. I'll need to detail the installation process for both the client and server components. Lastly, I'm thinking of standard sections such as contributing and license.

Here's a detailed GitHub project description for your ezyshare-files repository. This README.md covers the project's purpose, features, technologies, and provides clear instructions for setting it up and running it locally.
